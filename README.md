# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game in Python. It allows two players to take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 grid. The game ends when a player has three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or when all the cells on the grid have been filled.

## How to Play

    1. The game will display an empty 3x3 grid.

    2. Player 1 starts by choosing a position on the grid to place their mark (X). They will be prompted to enter the row and column numbers (both ranging from 0 to 2) separated by a space.

    3. Player 2 then selects a position to place their mark (O) following the same format.

    4. Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until a player wins or the game ends in a draw.

    5. The game will announce the winner or declare a draw, and then it will ask if you want to play again.
